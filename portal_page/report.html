            <strong>Client Report:</strong>
            I decided upon the content and images for my webpage by scrolling through Alex Hormozi's twitter, and then
            looking up stoisism quotes from blogs and other websites. I found their profile pictures from googling the
            person that said the quote. Most of the content was direct quotes from people I already knew of. My hero
            image I
            took from the book I have been reading: Berzerk.
            I communicated with my developer via email. There were no issues with communication he was fantastic!
            Once we were connected through the github repo, he got to work and exceeded all of my expectations. I
            uploaded
            all of the content and site plans into the repo which made the teamwork very easy.
            The next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I will make creating the repo and adding everyone to it
            a
            first priority. Having all of the materials in a central location made it so easy to be on the same page
            (pun
            un-intended).

            <strong>Lead Developer Report:</strong>
            The way I main way I comunicated with my junior devs was to speak with them in class. Both were fantastic
            and created their subpages quickly.
            I spoke with my client only once during this whole project. His site plans were fantastic! He gave us all
            the content from the beginning and it was easy to understand the purpose of each page.
            Once we had built the public hosting of the site using github, everytime a branch was merged it
            automatically handled building and updating the new version of the website.
            We did not run into many issues with GitHub and adding our changes to the site. Everyone developed out of a
            branch from main and I merged them as their pull requests came in.

            <strong>Junior Developer Report:</strong>
            There were often communication issues with my lead dev of the Mckinney project. My other lead developer did
            fantastic. We communicated in person during class the best because we could meet face to face.
            I knew what was expected of me for the 'Daily Motivation' website the best because I understood clearly the
            purpose of the subpage I would be building: A Login Page, although the content and css designing I had to
            create on the fly because we didn't have that specified. The other subpage I had to kind of put together
            with my client what the purpose of it was. From the wireframe, it was just the exact same as the others
            which was very confusing.
            I was able to contribute to both of my clients in big ways. Both of my sites were completed on time and
            published to the git repo.

            <strong>General Experience and Reflections:</strong>
            The most challenging part of the project was not having clear design documents to build the subpages from.
            That was the most important step, once I had those I could simply just go to work and get it done, but
            reaching out and having to wait for a lackluster response only increased the amount of time it took for me
            to build them.
            I enjoyed the most recieving feedback from Br. Hayes in class on my Lead Dev Website! I loved hearing how he
            would improve the styling and it all made sense. It was great feedback and very worth my time to get to see
            how he thought about designing websites.
            If I could do this project again, I would love to get to choose who I hire to be my developers. I would also
            do it so that you play each role but you build the whole website in a week, then switch roles next week and
            build a new website.
            I absolutely feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience. I learned how to
            use GITHUB!!!!!, MY EDITOR: VSCODE!!!!, develope site plans!!!, and work really fast and efficiently from
            the ice challenges!
